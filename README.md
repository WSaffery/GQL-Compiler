# GQL Compiler

A GQL to Gremlin transpiler written by William Saffery

This project was initially derived from Olaf Morra's GQL Parser, but has since significantly diverged from it.
Some parts of the ANTLR grammar and the visitors used for transforming it from GQL Parser remain in use.

This branch is unchanged from when the thesis was submitted, it includes many unusual files in unexpected places that 
are not intended for use by anyone who isn't trying to examine the results and development of my thesis.

The intention is to clean up the main branch and leave this one unchanged for posterity.
